    <section class="about-content">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Smart Station is an innovative IoT project designed to enhance your environment through ambient-aware music control. It integrates a binary clock, a light sensor, and audio playback capabilities to create a unique, interactive experience. The system displays time in a binary format, adjusts music playback based on ambient light conditions, and provides real-time sensor data through a user-friendly web interface.</p>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Binary Clock:</strong> Displays time using a binary representation of minutes and seconds, offering a modern and tech-savvy aesthetic.</li>
            <li><strong>Light Sensor:</strong> Measures ambient light levels to dynamically adjust music playback, creating an adaptive audio experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Audio Playback:</strong> Supports multiple audio tracks that can be controlled via the web interface, with seamless integration to the sensor data.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Data:</strong> Fetches and displays clock and sensor data through a responsive dashboard, updating every minute.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Technical Details</h3>
        <p>The Smart Station leverages a combination of hardware and software components. The binary clock and light sensor are connected to a microcontroller that communicates with a web server. The web interface, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, fetches data from an API to display real-time readings. The system is designed to be both functional and visually appealing, with a focus on user experience.</p>

        <h3>About the Creator</h3>
        <p>Smart Station was designed and developed by Daria Gladkykh as part of a project for the Faculty of Engineering in Foreign Languages at the University Politehnica of Bucharest. The project reflects a passion for combining technology, design, and user interaction to create innovative IoT solutions.</p>
